# Specification

### Purpose of the project
This app is a Pacman-style game that users can play to gain points and clear levels.  
   
### Features
- Users can play the game:
  - A level consists of a maze
  - Users play as a little character   
  - They can collect flowers to gain points
  - There are enemies roaming the maze, if they catch the character, the game is over
  - A level is cleared if a user manages to collect all points

### Extension ideas
- Login and registration
- A timer in the levels
- Special dots that, when collected, allow the character to eat the enemies for a short time, gaining extra points
- A highscore list for each level (based on time needed to clear the level and/or points collected)
- Different characters to choose from
