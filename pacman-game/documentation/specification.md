# Specification

### Purpose of the project
This app is a Pacman-style game that users can play to gain points and clear levels.  
   
### Planned features
- Users can sign up with a unique username and a password
- Users can log in with existing username and password
- Users can play the game:
  - Different levels consisting of mazes
  - Users play as a little character that has three lives
  - They can collect dots to gain points
  - There are enemies in the maze that try to catch the character, if they succeed, the character loses one life
  - A level is cleared if a user manages to collect all dots
  - The game is over if they lose all lives
 - Users can log out

### Extension ideas
- A timer in the levels
- Special dots that, when collected, allow the character to eat the enemies for a short time, gaining extra points
- A highscore list for each level (based on time needed to clear the level and/or points collected)
- Different characters to choose from
